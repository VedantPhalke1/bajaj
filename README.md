Here are some screenshots of the project:
Bajaj Spring Boot Webhook & SQL Solution App
📌 Overview

This project is a Spring Boot application built as part of the Bajaj Hiring Task.
The app demonstrates automation, API integration, and SQL problem-solving by following a predefined workflow:

On startup, the app generates a webhook URL via a POST request.

It then solves a SQL-based question assigned from a given problem set.

The final SQL query is securely submitted back to the webhook using a JWT token for authentication.

The process is fully automated – no manual controller endpoints are required to trigger the flow.
